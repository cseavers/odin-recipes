            <li>1 1/2 cups cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1 cup yellow or brown mustard</li>
            <li>1/2 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>1/3 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, smashed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cayenne</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly gound black pepper</li>
            <li>Pan drippings from the pork</li>
            <li>12 hamburger buns</li>
            <li>Pickle spears, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Instructions</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the paprika, garlic powder, brown sugar, dry mustard, and salt together in a small bowl. Rub the spice blend all over the pork. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Put the pork in a roasting pan and roast it for about 6 hours. An instant-read thermometer stuck into the thickest part of the pork should register 170 degrees F, but basically, what you want to do is to roast it until it's falling apart.</li>
            <li>While the port is roasting, make the barbecue sauce. Combine the vinegar, mustard, ketchup, brown sugar, garlic, salt, cayenne, and black pepper in a saucepan over medium heat. Simmer gently, stirring, for 10 minutes until the sugar dissolves. Take it off the heat and let it sit until you're ready for it.</li>
            <li>When the pork is done, take it out of the oven and put it on a large platter. Allow the meat to rest for about 10 minutes. While it's resting, deglaze the pan over medium heat with 3/4 cup water, scraping with a wooden spoon to pick up all of the browned bits. Reduce by about half. Pour that into the saucepan with the sauce and cook 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the pork is still warm, you want to "pull" the meat: Grab 2 forks. Using 1 to steady the meat, use the other to "pull" shreds of meat off the roast. Put the shredded pork in a bowl and pour half of the sauce over. Stir it all up well so that the pork is coated with the sauce.</li>
            <li>To serve, spoon the pulled pork mixture onto the bottom half of each hamburger bun, and top with some slaw. Serve with pickle spears and the remaining sauce on the side.</li>
        </ol>
